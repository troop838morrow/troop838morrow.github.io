Scouts and Parents,

We will meet Monday, 01/13.  Please use your best judgement to get to the church safely.
The church is closed today, so I expect the parking lot and sidewalks to be snow covered and slick.Use extra care
when walking there tomorrow night.Troop 838's meeting policy isthat in the event of a Snow Day called by Little
Miami Schools, we will still meet.  At that point, we leave it to the judgement of our Scouts parents / guardians as
to whether you can safely make it to the meeting.  If you decide that it is unsafe to attend, call your Patrol Leader
or Senior Patrol Leader and let them know.

-Mr. Blow
