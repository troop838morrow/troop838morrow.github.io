Hello Everyone,
Well...We survived summercamp. It was a hot one! Besides the heat and too many visits from Camp Friedlander medical staff, it was a great week.

We have several events coming up that I want to remind everyone of:
1. 7/27/19 and 7/28/19 - Soccerfest Flag Presentations at Little Miami High School from 8:00 - 9:00 AM. We will be presenting the colors for the start of each days Soccer Tournaments. Please wear Class A's and Merit Badge Sashes. This counts as S.M.A.S.H..
2. 8/3/19 - Troop 838 Annual Planning Meeting. We will be discussing our program activities for 2020, so please bring your ideas. Adults: nothing says we can't make our own plans, and the boys can come if they want :-)
3. 8/5/19 - PLC
4. 8/6/19 - National Night Out Parking. We will be providing parking services similar to Valley Vineyards parking at Oeder Lake from 5:30 to 7:30 PM.
5.
