Several people have asked about the Cyber Chip requirements. While some of them are in the Scout Handbook, there are others that are Age/Grade specific.

Here is a link to the requirements and training videos:

Parents, this involves you too! Your Scout is to create an Internet Contract that outlines appropriate usage, with your approval, and requires your sign-off.

In addition, Scouts are to teach part of the course to their patrol.
