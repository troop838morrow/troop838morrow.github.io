Scouts and Parents,
As a reminder, Troop 838 will hold our annual planning meeting on Saturday August 5 at Mr. Blow's house.  
Please make sure you have turned in your activity interest form to your SPL or your Scoutmaster.  
It starts at 9:00 AM and will last four hours or more.  If you are in the PLC this is MANDATORY. 
All Scouts are welcome to come. Lunch will be provided by the Troop.
  
   Your Webmaster
