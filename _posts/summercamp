Summer camp is doing good.  We are retiring flags on Wednesday night.  Also on Wednesday are the camp wide games.  The theme is worldwide games.  Our troop is hosting volleyball which originated in the Philippines. There are activities every night so there is always something to do at the lake, shooting ranges, and at different merit badge shelters. The merit badges are fun but usually on the first day not a lot happens. Trailblazer has some nights where younger scout are able to get harder requirements sign off like orienteering.  Lots of scouts go to the trading post to play cards during siesta every afternoon. The lake has the Camp Friedlander famous Blob and also has kayaks, canoes, paddleboards, small sailboats, and small motor boats used for merit badges.
