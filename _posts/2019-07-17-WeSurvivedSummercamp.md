Hello Everyone,
Well...We survived summercamp. It was a hot one! Besides the heat and too many visits from Camp Friedlander medical staff, it was a great week.

We have several events coming up that I want to remind everyone of:
1. 7/27/19 and 7/28/19 - Soccerfest Flag Presentations at Little Miami High School from 8:00 - 9:00 AM. We will be presenting the colors for the start of each days Soccer Tournaments. Please wear Class A's and Merit Badge Sashes. This counts as S.M.A.S.H..
2. 8/5/19 - PLC
3. 8/6/19 - National Night Out Parking. We will be providing parking services similar to Valley Vineyards parking at Oeder Lake from 5:30 to 7:30 PM.
4. 8/9/19 - Planning Campout and ILST Course at Stonelick Campground.

Also, our first meeting of the 2019-2020 school year will be 8/5 @ MUMC. We look forward to kicking off the new year of Scouting and hope to see you there!
