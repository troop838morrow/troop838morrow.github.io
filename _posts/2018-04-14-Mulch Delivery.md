Scouts and parents,

CONGRATULATIONS on selling and delivering all of our mulch. The entire 
process of loading up, delivering, and cleaning up mulch took about 8 
hours. We had ice cream from Wolfe's while we were there and the troop 
provided breakfast and lunch for those who helped. It rained while
we were delivering, so some people got wet while others were dry. If you
didn't help this year then it is HIGHLY recommended for next year
because it was very fun.
  
  Your webMASTER,
  Grant
