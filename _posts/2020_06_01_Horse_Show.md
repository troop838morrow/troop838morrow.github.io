Scouts and Parents,

This year we will be unable to participate in some of our annual fundraisers due to safety around COVID-19 and our desire
to follow the Scout Law to be Clean and Obedient. As such we are looking for alternative options. Dianna Schmidt has presented
us with a new opportunity. Please see the details below
