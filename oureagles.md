Steven Hill - Eagle Scout 2010

1. What are you doing now?

I joined the United States Army for 5 years (Nov 2013 - Nov 2018).  I am getting out as a SGT. 
My job was a Ranger Qualified Airborne Infantryman.  I deployed once to Afghanistan and was also stationed in Anchorage, Alaska as part of Cco 3/509th IN (ABN). 

2. What was your Eagle project?

My Eagle project was the restoration of a Civil War Battery located in Evergreen Cemetery in Fort Thomas, KY.  I redid all of the landscape, placed a sign giving a brief history of the battery and placed four flag poles that fly the flags of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. 


3. What was your favorite troop position and why?

My favorite position was SPL.  I enjoyed being a leader that my peers saw fit to plan and coordinate trips and training.  It helped shape the leader I am today. 


4. What are 2-3 of your favorite memories from Boy Scouts?

My favorite Scout memories are from the canoe trip we took for ten days on the Boundary Waters. My second greatest, was all of the time I got to spend with my grandfather as I grew up through Scouts.  The memories I have with him on many scouting trips I will cherish forever. 


5. What advice would you give to new scouts?

Take this opportunity and make the best of it.  The skills you learn today as a young man will follow you forever.  Becoming an Eagle Scout and graduating Ranger school are my two proudest accomplishments and I hope the new Scouts will strive to earn Eagle as well.  I hope they will understand how much it will benefit them in the future and will give back to their community.

# NICK STACEY

Q: What are you doing now?

A: Right now I'm pursuing a Bachelor's and then a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wright State University.

Q: What was your Eagle Project?

A:  For my Eagle Project, I teamed up with the Morrow Historical Society. Through them, I acquired the names of five people who had lived in Morrow their whole lives. I interviewed them and asked them about their life experiences and how Morrow had changed from when they were a kid to where it is now. I also collected any "artifacts" the interviewees were able to donate, like old receipts from their families business, and copies of pictures of old buildings. I then took the information and artifacts and I created five geocaches that explained some of the histories of Morrow and hid them in historic areas around the town.

Q: What was your favorite troop position and why?

A:  My favorite troop position was surprisingly SPL. I was SPL for a year and it was a great time. Even though the stresses were immense, which involved long nights of meetings with other patrol leaders and adult leaders, having serious talks with younger scouts, and basically running the troop, the interactions I had were amazing. I loved working with all the scouts as well as setting up other patrol leaders to help lead the troop after me.

Q: What are 2-3 of your favorite memories from Boy Scouts?

A: My favorite memory from Scouts would definitely be going to the Florida Sea Base. I lived on a boat for a week out in the Florida Keys with about 12 other boys from a troop based out of Northern Kentucky. We sailed to different islands and docks and learned about different biomes. We went snorkeling at beautiful reefs where the water was crystal clear. We saw amazing wildlife and were even able to catch some from the boat. At night our captain showed us different constellations and we watched his collection of The Cosmos by Neil Degrasse Tyson, which will always be my favorite documentary. At night I also slept on the deck of the ship, since we were one bed short. Being able to listen to the waves gently rock the boat, hear the sounds of the animals from the nearest island, and being able to look up at the stars is a memory I will never forget. 
My next favorite memory from Scouts was going to Boundry Waters in Montana, also known as Nothern Tier. We drove up, which was a great experience on its own, and took two days. We were on the water for 10 days, canoeing to different campsites every night. We would canoe about 5-10 miles every day, which included portages which were when we had to get out of the canoe and carry all our gear, including the canoe, across the land to the next lake. The worst portage we had was about a quarter mile long and had 2 massive hills in it. Our two food packs started off weighing about 100 pounds each and this was the second or third day so they were still pretty hefty. Each of the 8 of us in the group had our own packs with all our gear in it, day packs, fishing stuff, 2 tents, and 4 canoes to transfer. It took each of us about 3-4 trips to transfer everything so all in all, each of us walked about 2 miles just for that one portage. That being said, it was still a great experience! The views there were amazing, the water was beautiful, and the fish tasted amazing. 
Those were both High Adventure trips and will forever be my favorite memories. There is one High Adventure I haven't been on and still wish to do which is Philmont. Overall, I would say any High Adventure trip will be amazing and I definitely recommend.

Q: What advice would you give to new Scouts?

A: Advice that I would give to younger Scouts would be that as you progress through Scouts and it becomes more challenging, don't let that stop you. You get everything out of Scouts that you put in, and if you put in your best work, great things will happen. They say that there are 3 W's that stop Scouts from obtaining Eagle. Those W's are Wheels, Work, and Women. While each of those has affected me on my journey, I never let it stop me from reaching my goal. Even though I pushed the deadline as far as I possibly could, I never gave up. I may have turned in my Eagle paperwork the week that I turned 18, and had my Eagle Board of Review three days after I turned 18 but I didn't let those stresses overcome me. I worked with many adult leaders who helped push me to finish strong and I used almost every resource available to me. If I hadn't reached out and sought help I probably would not have gotten Eagle. So my advice is to not let stress stop you from reaching your goals, but if you do become overwhelmed, reach out to any adult in the troop and they will more than happily help you in any way you need.



# JOSH HULTGREN

Q: What are you doing now?

A:I'm serving as an infantryman in the US Army

Q: What was your Eagle Project?

A:I built a 40ft boardwalk at Fort Ancient state reserve
 
Q: What was your favorite troop position and why?

A:My favorite troop position was troop guide, because I got to help newer scouts with the transition
from Webelo to Boyscout and help them get to know the troop.

Q: What are some of your favorite memories from Boy Scouts?

A:Some of my favorite memories from scouting are pranks at summer camp, and backpacking in the Boundary
Waters

Q: What advice would you give to new Scouts?

A:Some advice that I would like to give the scouts is that making Eagle is worth the time and effort because
it benefits you in later life. For instance I enlisted as an E-2 rather and an E-1 when I joined the Army.
And Eagle Scout always looks good on a resume.

# JAKE BURNS

Q: What are you doing now?

A: Right now I am currently living in Asheville, North Carolina as a working musician. I am the acting 
manager, booking agent and lead singer and guitarist for a touring rock band named Rockstead as well as 
book and perform my own solo shows.

Q: What was your Eagle Project?

A:For my Eagle Scout project I raised the funds for and organized the installation of the illuminated sign
for the Salem Township public library. This involved collecting donations from local businesses, writing 
to our governors and congressmen and woman as well as working with our local library to design a sign a 
develop the best overall plan.

Q: What was your favorite troop position and why?

A:The position I enjoyed most was Senior Patrol Leader. This was because I liked to communicate with each
individual Patrol Leader on what they were doing and their plans for their specific patrols. From there,
watching how they carried out their said plan and how each scout advanced accordingly was really cool to see.

Q: What are some of your favorite memories from Boy Scouts?

A: Easily one of my favorite memories from Boy Scouts was when our troop spent a week out on the Boundary Waters
in Northern Minnesota. We canoed from island to island with all our own provisions. There was rain, heat, bugs,
extremely long paddles and portages but the serenity of the land and the wildlife we saw made it all worth it.
    Another one of my favorite memories was always the Klondike Derby. Teaming up with your friends in the snow
was always a good time and preparing for all the events leading up to the day was exciting with everything being
a time trial. Definitely miss those events.

Q: What advice would you give to new Scouts?

A:To new scouts I would say the whole experience is what you make of it. I hear so many kids dropping out of
Scouts because they claim their troop "doesn't do anything". If you're troop isn't doing what you want it to do,
speak up! Talk to your Senior Patrol leader or the rest of your troop about your vision and what activities you
want to be participating in. Organize fund raisers, reach out to local businesses for sponsors, get everyone on
the same page and work together to achieve your goals because in the end, when you reach your Eagle Scout rank,
you can be proud of what you accomplished for not only yourself but for your troop as a whole.
