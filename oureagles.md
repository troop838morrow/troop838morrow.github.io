Q: What are you doing now?

A: Right now I'm pursuing a Bachelor's and then a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wright State University.

Q: What was your Eagle Project?

A:  For my Eagle Project, I teamed up with the Morrow Historical Society. Through them, I acquired the names of five people who had lived in Morrow their whole lives. I interviewed them and asked them about their life experiences and how Morrow had changed from when they were a kid to where it is now. I also collected any "artifacts" the interviewees were able to donate, like old receipts from their families business, and copies of pictures of old buildings. I then took the information and artifacts and I created five geocaches that explained some of the histories of Morrow and hid them in historic areas around the town.

Q: What was your favorite troop position and why?

A:  My favorite troop position was surprisingly SPL. I was SPL for a year and it was a great time. Even though the stresses were immense, which involved long nights of meetings with other patrol leaders and adult leaders, having serious talks with younger scouts, and basically running the troop, the interactions I had were amazing. I loved working with all the scouts as well as setting up other patrol leaders to help lead the troop after me.

Q: What are 2-3 of your favorite memories from Boy Scouts?

A: My favorite memory from Scouts would definitely be going to the Florida Sea Base. I lived on a boat for a week out in the Florida Keys with about 12 other boys from a troop based out of Northern Kentucky. We sailed to different islands and docks and learned about different biomes. We went snorkeling at beautiful reefs where the water was crystal clear. We saw amazing wildlife and were even able to catch some from the boat. At night our captain showed us different constellations and we watched his collection of The Cosmos by Neil Degrasse Tyson, which will always be my favorite documentary. At night I also slept on the deck of the ship, since we were one bed short. Being able to listen to the waves gently rock the boat, hear the sounds of the animals from the nearest island, and being able to look up at the stars is a memory I will never forget. 
My next favorite memory from Scouts was going to Boundry Waters in Montana, also known as Nothern Tier. We drove up, which was a great experience on its own, and took two days. We were on the water for 10 days, canoeing to different campsites every night. We would canoe about 5-10 miles every day, which included portages which were when we had to get out of the canoe and carry all our gear, including the canoe, across the land to the next lake. The worst portage we had was about a quarter mile long and had 2 massive hills in it. Our two food packs started off weighing about 100 pounds each and this was the second or third day so they were still pretty hefty. Each of the 8 of us in the group had our own packs with all our gear in it, day packs, fishing stuff, 2 tents, and 4 canoes to transfer. It took each of us about 3-4 trips to transfer everything so all in all, each of us walked about 2 miles just for that one portage. That being said, it was still a great experience! The views there were amazing, the water was beautiful, and the fish tasted amazing. 
Those were both High Adventure trips and will forever be my favorite memories. There is one High Adventure I haven't been on and still wish to do which is Philmont. Overall, I would say any High Adventure trip will be amazing and I definitely recommend.

Q: What advice would you give to new Scouts?

A: Advice that I would give to younger Scouts would be that as you progress through Scouts and it becomes more challenging, don't let that stop you. You get everything out of Scouts that you put in, and if you put in your best work, great things will happen. They say that there are 3 W's that stop Scouts from obtaining Eagle. Those W's are Wheels, Work, and Women. While each of those has affected me on my journey, I never let it stop me from reaching my goal. Even though I pushed the deadline as far as I possibly could, I never gave up. I may have turned in my Eagle paperwork the week that I turned 18, and had my Eagle Board of Review three days after I turned 18 but I didn't let those stresses overcome me. I worked with many adult leaders who helped push me to finish strong and I used almost every resource available to me. If I hadn't reached out and sought help I probably would not have gotten Eagle. So my advice is to not let stress stop you from reaching your goals, but if you do become overwhelmed, reach out to any adult in the troop and they will more than happily help you in any way you need.
